Assignment: Extra credit!
Now that you know how to convert digits to check amounts in words from the previous assignment, how about converting check amounts in words *back* into digits?

For example:

"nine thousand six hundred forty five dollars" converts to 9645 in digits.  As before, prepare to handle amounts from one dollar to nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars.

You may show the result either with or without the "thousands" comma separator, and with or without a dollar sign ($).

A correct solution will receive up to 15 extra points, which is half of a usual 30-point assignment.

Good luck!
